[Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold) is a geometry library dedicated to creating and operating on manifold triangle meshes. A [manifold mesh](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/wiki/Manifold-Library#manifoldness) is a mesh that represents a solid object, and so is very important in manufacturing, CAD, structural analysis, etc. Further information can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/elalish/manifold/wiki/Manifold-Library).
